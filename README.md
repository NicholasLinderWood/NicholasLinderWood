- Hello! My name is Nicholas Wood. My current position is as an Assitant Research Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the United States Naval Academy. My research is focused on all aspects of solid organ transplant, however I focus on liver transplantation specifically. Within that particular organ my research tends to be centered around questions related to organ allocation policy. The primary purpose of this GitHub is as a repository for code I create to run the analyses for papers I have published. My hope is that other researchers interested in the same kind of projects will double check my work. If you have any questions for me, or wish to collaborate on any projects, I can be reached at nwood@usna.edu

- Some additional coding hobbies of mine are the generation of mathematical images (e.g. fractals) and of cellular automata. As I get around to it, I may additionally upload these kinds of projects as well.
